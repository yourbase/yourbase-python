# This file sets up YourBase pytest integration.
#
# For projects using pytest, the project only needs to add yourbase to its
# requirements file. This file will be run as an entry point (via setup.py) and
# will attach to pytest hooks so that tests do not need to be decorated.
#
# For projects not using pytest, or when running outside of the YourBase CI,
# this file does nothing.

            Called by pytest after tests are collected but before they start
            to run. `items` is mutable.

            Modern pytest's signature for this function is
            `pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items)`, but
            pytest will check argument names before calling it and call with
            exactly the right arguments so that plugins gain forward
            compaitibility for free.

            For this reason, we shouldn't update this function signature to
            the modern version until we need something from it, as it would
            potentially break compatibility with older pytest versions. We
            also should not rename the arguments as this would prevent pytest
            from identifying them and cause it to error.
