# YourBase Python Skipper

## What is this?

This is a Python package you can use in conjunction with [YourBase](https://yourbase.io).

## What does it do?

YourBase has a unique test acceleration that records the execution of your
tests and builds a dependency graph that it can use to bypass tests that do not
need to be run based on the changes in a commit. This helps to make those
commands much finer-grained enabling more acceleration. 

To achieve this, when running in the YourBase CI, this package will load a
lighweight wrapper for Python that will determine if a test needs to run based
on the YourBase runtime dependency graph. 

## How do I use this?

Simply run
```python
pip install yourbase
```
and decorate your tests with `@accelerate_tests`:
```python
@accelerate_tests
class TestApplication:
    # ...
```

When you run your tests locally it will have no impact at all, other than
notifying that it won't accelerate your tests. When you run your tests in the
YourBase CI, they will be accelerated where possible.
